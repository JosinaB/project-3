For this project we decided to create a Fund Marketplace, to support Ukraina ocupation.
the idea of this project is for artist to donate their digital art into a marketplace, where people can buy and re-sell the art.
the premise of this project is to donate all the proceeds fund to a secure wallet belong to a non-profit organization.

we'll be creating a DAPP for the minting of the NFT, and the selling of it.
